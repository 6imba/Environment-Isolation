Local Installation:
    or, Redis server from the official website (https://redis.io/download)
    or, use a package manager like apt for Ubuntu
    or, use a package manager like brew for macOS
    or, there is no way to install redis in window, instead you need to go via WSL


# More technically, WSL lets you run unmodifiesd L64 Linuxbinaries on Windows.
